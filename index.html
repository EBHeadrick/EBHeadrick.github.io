            <h1>What we do</h1>
            <p>
                Boulder Insurance Group was founded to give clear, honest personal insurance consulting.
                Our emphasis on individual and group health insurance makes navigating the various choices easier.
                The whole process starts with a personal interview to discover your own individual insurance needs.
                Information is gathered about things like your current insurance, budget, deductible tolerance,
                and what plans your doctor accepts.
                Hospital choice can be an important factor; some health insurance plans only work with certain hospitals.
                We are independent insurance agents that work for our clients to find the best solutions to their
                individual needs.  The best part is, the companies pay us, not our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We take pride in our ability to bring the same objective viewpoint to
                serving our customers life insurance, long term care insurance, medicare supplement insurance,
                and tax advantaged retirement planning needs. We have the ability to compare insurance plans with you
                so that you receive the right coverage for your lifestyle and situation.

                        One of the best books I have read lately is "The Last Chance Millionaire" by Douglas Andrews.
                        The website is at <a href="http://www.missedfortune.com">www.missedfortune.com</a>.
                        Since I am a little nutty about financial strategies,
                        this was a book I couldn't put down. I started reading it because a friend had sent it to me in the mail.
                        I was obligated to at least read the first paragraph. That happened on a Friday afternoon during the
                        busiest month of my career so far. Despite looming deadlines and meetings to prepare for, I finished the
                        whole thing by Monday morning. One of my clients later said to me "oh yeah, I got that quote you sent me
                        at 1:00 in the morning, what were you doing up so late?" My website developer asked "why haven't you
                        finished those articles yet?"  That's how good it was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last week I was at a training seminar in Phoenix for one of my favorite (most stable) companies,
                        and got back exhausted and wanting to be with my family. Another book had arrived, this time from
                        somebody else. It was Called "Tax-Free Retirement" by Patrick Kelly see
                        <a href="http://www.taxfreebook.com">www.taxfreebook.com</a>.
                        My quality family time for the last three days was with me reading in the living room while
                        my son played on the floor with Lego's, and my wife watched TV.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After meeting with an associate Friday to cover some investment strategies, I mentioned these books
                        to my friend. His response was "oh yeah that whole infinite banking concept is really starting to pick
                        up steam." My next book to read will be based on his suggestion
                        "Becoming Your Own Banker," by Nelson Nash.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are all based on concepts I have been studying for the last two years.
                        My biggest question is why don't more people know about this? I'll get back to that later.
                        One website that caught my interest early on was
                        <a href="http://www.fleewallstreet.com">www.fleewallstreet.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The story from my childhood that has always stuck with me was the one about my god parents.
                        They started out their family on the same block as my parents in a house that cost $18,000.
                        From these meager beginnings, Mr. G became quite wealthy. They lived in a mansion on a vast estate.
                        Well at least it was bigger than our whole neighborhood. They had a pool that we swam in a lot growing up.
                        They had several horses too. I would get presents from Mrs. G on my birthday from exotic places like
                        Hawaii and Spain. Then something happened. Something Changed.
                        The pool got filled in, and the horses were gone. Their property got smaller and smaller.
                        Eventually they moved to a smaller house, then into a duplex.

                    <h2>Tax Deferral Example</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you take a dollar and double it, you will have 2 dollars.
                        If you do this 20 times, you will have $1,000,000.
                        Lets see how tax deferral can affect this exercise.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Examples</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Invest in a tax deferred strategy, and pay a 33% tax at the end.
                            That leaves $702,545.92.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            we pay the 33% tax each time we double the money.  After doubling the original
                            dollar 20 times and paying taxes each time it doubles, there is only $28,466.20.

            <p>
                Life Insurance is the one kind of insurance that will always be used.
                There are many variables to consider when this kind of product, for it can be used as a protection and
                source of stability in today's unpredictable world.  For children, life insurance can be a way that
                parents or grandparents set up a fund that can be used tax-free later in life for education, or for major
                purchases.  During young adulthood it can be used to provide a spouse with income in case of premature
                death. In middle age, it can be used to protect a spouse, children, or to pay off a mortgage.
                In old age, life insurance can be used to provide for final expenses.  What many people don't realize
                is that life insurance can be used to fund a retirement with tax free income.  Life insurance has many
                benefits for the living too!  One thing important to understand is that the younger you are when you start
                a life insurance policy, the less it will cost.

                <h2>Term</h2>
                <p>Term Life Insurance costs less than whole life insurance, but does not build cash value.
                    It lasts for a specific number of years, or term.  Usually the term is 10, 20, or 30 years.
                    The cost is based on age at issue, and stays the same thru out the term.  Some term policies can be
                    converted to whole life without evidence of insurability.  This is an excellent way to start out with
                    the coverage amount you need, and convert to whole life as your financial situation improves.

                    premiums for 10 or 20 years, and some are paid up at age 65.  Whole life policies build cash value that can
                    be used later. Money can be surrendered, or taken out as a loan, but be careful!  If money is not drawn out
                    properly, it can be a taxable event, or even cause the policy to lapse prematurely.

                    Long Term Care is Chronic Care.  Chronic Care can be defined as Care given over a long time period without
                    the expectation of the patient returning to good health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long Term Care can include services that are medical and non-medical in nature, and provide for the health
                    and well being of the patient.  Often, Long Term Care does not require skilled medical professionals;
                    it begins at home with assistance provided by family members, neighbors, or friends.  Loved ones acting as
                    caregivers deliver Custodial Care, which includes transportation, shopping, managing finances, and help with
                    the 6 activities of daily living.  These activities of daily living are clearly defined in the medical, and
                    insurance community;  They are eating, bathing dressing, toileting, continence, and transferring
                    (eg. Moving from bed to a chair).  Sometimes a patient will require constant observation and assistance for dementia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long Term Care can be provided in a variety of settings:

                </ul>
                are the most common places
                to receive care.  Because Long Term Care usually does not require the assistance of skilled medical
                professionals, it is usually not covered by health insurance or by Medicare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most Long Term Care is financed by private funds (self-insurance), Medicaid, or by Long Term Care Insurance.

                    Many of our new clients are unaware that policies can be structured in such a way that any unused premiums
                    can be returned to a beneficiary.  They can also be structured to be paid up within a certain time period,

                    Disability Insurance is the foundation of any financial plan.  It protects the source of funding for
                    all of the other planning.  Despite the importance of Disability Insurance, it is the most commonly
                    overlooked component of a protection strategy.  A person in their 40's is almost twice as likely to
                    lose income for 90 days or more due to a disability, than they are to lose income due to premature death.

                    Boulder Insurance Group is dedicated to helping our customers choose the correct mix of coverages and

                <h2>Long Term Disability</h2>
                <p>
                Long Term Disability Insurance is intended to replace income during an extended illness, or
                rehabilitation. None of us expect to become seriously injured. In fact, like Life Insurance,
                people often overlook securing disability coverage because they just don't want to deal with the
                unpleasant thought of needing to use it. However, having protection against the unexpected can
                prevent hassles, skyrocketing medical bills, and heartache during a time of crisis.
                At Boulder Insurance Group, we believe that worrying about medical expenses and lost in come
                should be the last thing on your mind when you're recovering from a long-term illness or injury.
                We can work with you to set up a plan that will bring peace of mind you need to restore your health
                as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                Long term disability insurance has a longer elimination period than short term disability insurance,
                usually 90 or 180 days.  The policies can last for 2 years or more, even until age 65.

                <h2>Short Term Disability</h2>
                <p>
                    In the event of an unexpected accident, you might find yourself unable to work for a short period
                    of time. If you do not have enough paid leave from work, you might experience an interruption in
                    your income. Short Term Disability Insurance is designed to fill in the gaps while you recover.
                </p>
                <p>
                After a short elimination period, usually 3 days, the policy will begin to pay a daily benefit
                directly to the individual.  This money can then be used to pay bills that would normally be paid
                from the lost income.
                There are limits to what percentage of income can be replaced, and there are strategies to
                maximize this income. Short Term Disability Insurance usually only lasts for 90 days; if coverage
                is needed for a longer period, Long Term Disability Insurance kicks in. There are many short term
                disability providers and plans to choose from.

            <h1>Estate Planning</h1>
            <p>
                Estate planning includes wills, directives, and trusts. The basic concept is to maximize the
                money that goes to your family or favorite charity, and to ensure that your final wishes are
                carried out. You should seek the help of a legal professional before taking any action on the
                legal issues involved in estate planning.  Boulder Insurance Group does not give legal advice,
                but encourages all of our customers to engage in at least minimal estate planning activities.
                To this end, we have provided some more detail below. The following is for informational purposes,
                to support our valued customers: Estate Planning - Wills A will is a legal document that determines
                the succession of your estate. Without a will, the state will distribute the entire estate according
                to predetermined rules. In other words, your final wishes may not be carried out the way you desire
                unless your estate planning documents contain a will.  For families with small children, your will
                is to provide for your children in the event of your premature death. In addition to providing for
                their care and upbringing, the guardian will have control of the proceeds from any life insurance
                policies until they reach maturity. This is a very broad comment on the very complicated subject
                of estate planning so please seek legal counsel.   In general life insurance companies will not
                distribute life insurance proceeds to a minor. Estate Planning - Directives Directives are a critical
                part of estate planning if you want to have your wishes carried out, and not put tremendous decision
                making burdens on your loved ones. Directives cover issues like Do Not Resuscitate Orders, medical
                and financial Power of Attorney, and final wishes.  This part of Estate Planning allows a person to
                name someone to act on their behalf in financial or medical situations when they are not able to do
                so themselves. Estate Planning is the process of helping people ensure that their assets are
                distributed according to their wishes. In the case of a complex estate, complex planning can be
                used to minimize the amount of estate tax due upon the person’s death.
                Boulder Insurance Group’s estate planning experts can help you navigate this complex issue and
                choose the most relevant structure for you. We’re also able to work directly with your financial
                advisor, attorney and/or accountant to meet your estate planning needs.

            <h1>Living Trust</h1>
            <p>
            Trusts are an arrangement where real or personal property is held by a trustee for the benefit of another
            person (the beneficiary). There are two basic kinds of trusts; testamentary trusts are formed at your death
            and a living trust is established during your lifetime.  In a funded living trust, the settlor puts money
            and property into their trust during their lifetime for their own benefit, and possibly for the benefit of
            others. When a person is capable of managing their own affairs, they usually name themselves as trustee of
            the living trust they establish.  The duties of the trustee are to invest and distribute the assets of the
            trust to the settlor and beneficiaries.   Choosing a Revocable or Irrevocable Living Trust.  Living trusts
            are almost always revocable, which means the settlor can revoke or amend the trust as long as they live, or
            as long as they are capable of managing their own affairs. Alternate trustees can be named to take over the
            trustee duties if the settlor becomes disabled or unable to perform their duties.   When the settlor dies,
            the living trust usually terminates, and the successor trustee distributes the trust property to the
            beneficiaries, similar to the distribution from a will.  Often times, a living trust will continue after
            the death of the settlor in order to provide benefits to the settlor’s spouse and family.
            The living trust will then terminate at a later date.  If a living trust is set up properly, and fully
            funded (all of the settlor’s assets are put into the trust), there can be several advantages. A fully
            funded living trust can eliminate the need for probate upon the death of the settlor. If a settlor owns
            property in multiple states, it can possibly eliminate the need for probate in multiple states.
            A living trust may eliminate the need for conservatorship if the settlor becomes disabled or unable to
            fulfill the duties of trustee. However, a separate medical power of attorney is needed in order to make
            medical decisions for the settlor.  The terms of a living trust are generally private whereas the terms
            of a will are public.  Your Living Trust and Taxes:  If a living trust is not drafted correctly, there can
            be significant harmful tax liabilities. It’s usually better to have professional assistance in drafting
            either a testamentary or living trust instead of trying to do it yourself, or by purchasing a preprinted
            trust form.  It’s best for you to keep an up to date list of all your property and debts.
            Things to include are insurance policies, securities, bank accounts, real estate, artwork, jewelry,
            business interests, pension plans, IRA’s, and other retirement benefits. You should keep this list with
            your other important documents.  It’s best to keep a list of your current financial advisors, your attorney,
            and your accountant in a safe, easy to find place also. There are many variables to weigh in the creation
            of a living trust so professional help is a must to be sure your wishes are honored.
